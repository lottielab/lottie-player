```

## üìú Usage

### üîµ Web Component (HTML)

The easiest way to get started is to import the script via CDN, preferably inside
your `<head>` element:

```html
<script src="...TODO..."></script>
```

Then, to play a Lottie:

```html
<lottie-player src="path/to/your-animation.json" autoplay loop></lottie-player>
```

---

If you already have a build pipeline, you might prefer loading the script from
within your code. You can simply import the file:

```javascript
import '@lottielab/lottie-player/web';
// or: import '@lottielab/lottie-player';
```

...and then use the `<lottie-player>` component from anywhere, like in the
example above.

---

The player can also be used programatically like any other HTML component:

```javascript
import Lottie from '@lottielab/lottie-player/web';
// or: import { LottieWeb } from '@lottielab/lottie-player';

const lottie = new LottieWeb();
lottie.setAttribute('src', 'path/to/your-animation.json');
lottie.setAttribute('autoplay', 'true');
lottie.setAttribute('loop', 'false');
document.getElementById('my-animation').appendChild(lottie);
lottie.play();
lottie.setSpeed(1.5);
lottie.goToAndStop(50, true);
// and so on...
```

#### API

##### Attributes

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src`      | string  | The source path or JSON data for the Lottie animation. |
| `autoplay` | boolean | Whether the animation should autoplay.                 |
| `loop`     | (boolean  \| number) | Whether the animation should loop, optionally pass a number to set the number of loops an animation should play. |

##### Methods

| Name | Parameters | Description |
| ---- | ---------- | ----------- |
| `play()` | `void` | Plays the Lottie animation. |
| `stop()` | `void` | Stops the Lottie animation, resetting the animation to frame 0. |
| `pause()` | `void` | Pauses the Lottie animation at the current frame. |
| `setSpeed(speed)` | `(speed: number)` | Sets the speed of the animation. `speed`: The speed factor. |
| `seek(time)` | `(time: number)` | Seeks Lottie animation to a specific point in time, in seconds. |
| `seekToFrame(frame)` | `(frame: number)` | Seeks Lottie animation to specified frame. |
| `setDirection(direction)` | `(direction: 1 \| -1)` | Sets the direction of the animation, 1 for forward, -1 for reverse. |
| `loopBetween(frame1, frame2)` | `(frame1: number, frame2: number)` | Loops between two frames within the Lottie animation. |
| `getDuration()` | `void` | Returns the duration of the animation in seconds. |
| `getDurationInFrames()` | `void` | Returns the duration of the animation in frames. |

##### Getters/Setters

| Name | Parameters | Description |
| ---- | ---------- | ----------- |
| `playing` | `(boolean)` | Gets/Sets whether the Lottie animation is playing or paused. Inverse of `paused`. |
| `paused` | `(boolean)`| Gets/Sets whether the Lottie animation is playing or paused. Inverse of `playing`. |
| `currentTime` | `(timeInSeconds: number)`| Gets/Sets the current time in seconds of the Lottie animation. If setting, this will seek the animation to that point in time. |
| `currentFrame` | `(frame: number)` | Gets/Sets the current frame of the Lottie animation. If setting, this will seek the animation to that frame. |
| `duration` | `Getter only` | Gets the duration of the Lottie animation in seconds. |
| `durationFrames` | `Getter only`| Gets the duration of the Lottie animation in frames. |
| `direction` | `(direction: 1 \| -1)`| Gets or Sets the current direction. |
| `speed` | `(speed:number)`| Gets or Sets the current speed factor. |

---

### üîµ React Component

Import the component:

```javascript
import Lottie from '@lottielab/lottie-player/react';
// or: import { LottieReact } from '@lottielab/lottie-player';
```

Then use it:

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => <Lottie src="path/to/your-animation.json" />;
```

Alternatively, you can provide the lottie JSON directly, rather than a URL. This
can be easier, since it can integrate better with your build pipeline and
bundler:

```javascript
import myAnimation from './path/to/your/animation.json';
// Note: make sure to setup JSON imports in your build pipeline

const MyComponent = () => <Lottie lottie={myAnimation} />;
```
